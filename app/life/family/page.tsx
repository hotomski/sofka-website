            I come from a family where thinking deeply and caring deeply went hand in hand.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My dad was a university professor and mathematician who taught artificial intelligence, mathematical logic, and principles of programming—long before those fields were fashionable. He shaped not only generations of students, but also us—his four daughters. Yes, all girls. Yes, all engineers. I’m the youngest of the bunch, and we’re now scattered across three continents and four countries: Novi Sad, Boston, Sydney, and Zurich.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My mum, on the other hand, was a primary school teacher with a heart full of love for children—and that heart hasn&apos;t changed a bit. While my dad taught us to think critically, she taught us to care deeply. Together, they created a home where curiosity and kindness were part of everyday life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In 2011, life reminded us how fragile it can be. We lost my dad to a lung condition. That same year, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through surgery, chemo, and radiation—and survived. She&apos;s a fighter, and one of my greatest inspirations to this day.

          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            I met my husband at work back in 2012 (I think! My memory’s better with people than with dates 😊). We started dating in December 2013, moved to Switzerland, and got married in May 2015. He’s been my biggest support ever since: a calm, steady presence, full of positive energy, and my personal anchor when life gets stormy.

            Although I’m the one who plays the ukulele and guitar, he’s the true music curator at home. He’s introduced me to some of my all-time favorite artists, and our home always has a soundtrack—thanks to his impeccable taste and very enthusiastic playlist management.

            In January 2020, we got a cat—a total diva who quickly took charge of household dynamics. Then came our son Petar in 2021, named after my dad, and our daughter Nina in 2023. Life hasn’t been the same since—and I mean that in the most beautiful, overwhelming, transformative way.

            Parenthood has stretched us, humbled us, and changed us for good. It tests our limits daily, yet somehow makes us stronger and more grounded than ever. After five long years, we finally sleep through the night (most nights). Ironically, it all started with the cat, who managed to wake us more than both kids combined.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This is our story. It’s full of love, math, music, chaos, and cats—and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.
