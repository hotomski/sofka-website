            I come from a family where thinking deeply and caring deeply went hand in hand.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My dad was a university professor and mathematician who taught artificial intelligence, mathematical logic, and principles of programmingâ€”long before those fields were fashionable. He shaped not only generations of students, but also usâ€”his four daughters. Yes, all girls. Yes, all engineers. Iâ€™m the youngest of the bunch, and weâ€™re now scattered across three continents and four countries: Novi Sad, Boston, Sydney, and Zurich.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            My mum, on the other hand, was a primary school teacher with a heart full of love for childrenâ€”and that heart hasn&apos;t changed a bit. While my dad taught us to think critically, she taught us to care deeply. Together, they created a home where curiosity and kindness were part of everyday life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In 2011, life reminded us how fragile it can be. We lost my dad to a lung condition. That same year, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through surgery, chemo, and radiationâ€”and survived. She&apos;s a fighter, and one of my greatest inspirations to this day.

            I met my husband at work back in 2012 (I think! My memoryâ€™s better with people than with dates ðŸ˜Š). We started dating in December 2013, moved to Switzerland, and got married in May 2015â€”ten years ago now. Heâ€™s been my biggest support ever since: a calm, steady presence, full of positive energy, and my personal anchor when life gets stormy.

            Although Iâ€™m the one who plays the ukulele and guitar, heâ€™s the true music curator at home. Heâ€™s introduced me to some of my all-time favorite artists, and our home always has a soundtrackâ€”thanks to his impeccable taste and very enthusiastic playlist management.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            In January 2020, we got a catâ€”a total diva who quickly took charge of household dynamics. Then came our son Petar in 2021, named after my dad, and our daughter Nina in 2023. Life hasnâ€™t been the same sinceâ€”and I mean that in the most beautiful, overwhelming, transformative way.

            Parenthood has stretched us, humbled us, and changed us for good. It tests our limits daily, yet somehow makes us stronger and more grounded than ever. After five long years, we finally sleep through the night (most nights). Ironically, it all started with the cat, who managed to wake us more than both kids combined.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
            This is our story. Itâ€™s full of love, math, music, chaos, and catsâ€”and I wouldnâ€™t trade it for anything.
